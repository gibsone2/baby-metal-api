## Babymetal API

This is an API I created using Airtable. Airtable is a spreadsheet     
database hybrid, with the features of a database but applied to a     
spreadsheet.  

Airtable allows one to prototype projects quickly.  Simply setup     
the spreadsheet with the data, create a lightweight node backend    
to process the data, host on a site like Netlify (for free), create     
the url's to the data and you're good to go.
